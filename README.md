## Usage

### Quick Start - 3 Easy Steps!

**Step 1 — Launch interactive mode**
```bash
node snifferx.js
```

**Step 2 — Run a quick health check (optional but recommended)**
```bash
snifferx> doctor       # Verifies Node version, tshark, permissions, exports
```

**Step 3 — Start monitoring**
```bash
snifferx> start        # Guided setup (easiest)
snifferx> auto         # Auto-detect interface
snifferx> interfaces   # List available interfaces
snifferx> help         # Get help
snifferx> exit         # Exit when done
```
SnifferX will walk you through selecting the right interface, testing audio alerts, and exporting your first session.

### Essential Commands Cheat Sheet

| Command | When to use | What it does |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| `start` | First run | Guided wizard that lists interfaces and shows next steps |
| `auto` | You just want to begin | Auto-detects the best interface and starts monitoring |
| `doctor` | Unsure if your setup is ready | Checks Node version, admin rights, tshark, export folder, and audio backend |
| `interfaces` | Need to choose an adapter | Lists every capture interface with IDs |
| `monitor -i <id>` | Ready to sniff traffic | Starts full monitoring on the selected interface |
| `stats` | Need quick telemetry | Shows tool version, Node version, platform, uptime, memory |
| `exports` | Review past sessions | Prints export history with timestamps and file sizes |

### Alternative - Direct Commands

You can also run commands directly:

```bash
# Guided Setup (Recommended for first-time users)
node snifferx.js start

# Auto-detect and start immediately
node snifferx.js auto

# Run diagnostics before monitoring
node snifferx.js doctor

# Manual interface selection
node snifferx.js interfaces        # List interfaces
node snifferx.js monitor -i 7      # Start monitoring interface 7
```

## Configuration

Edit `config.js` to customize detection thresholds:

```javascript
detection: {
    ddos: {
        packetsPerSecondThreshold: 1000,    // Packets/sec to trigger alert
        connectionsThreshold: 100,           // Max connections from single IP
        timeWindow: 60                       // Analysis window (seconds)
    },
    portScanning: {
        portsPerMinute: 20,                 // Distinct ports threshold
        timeWindow: 60                       // Detection window
    },
    ipSpoofing: {
        ttlVarianceThreshold: 40,           // TTL deviation tolerance
        enableSequenceCheck: true            // TCP sequence validation
    },
    userBehavior: {
        learningPhaseDuration: 3600,        // Learning phase (1 hour)
        riskThreshold: 70                    // Risk score alert threshold
    }
}
```

### Audio Configuration

```javascript
audio: {
    enabled: true,                          // Enable/disable audio alerts
    volume: 0.7,                            // Volume level (0.0-1.0)
    cooldown: 5000,                         // Milliseconds between alerts
    playOnStartup: true,                    // Startup sound
    playOnShutdown: true,                   // Shutdown sound
    emergencyThreshold: 5                   // Alerts for emergency siren
}
```

## Audio Alert System

SnifferX features a **revolutionary audio alert system** - the first network monitor with real-time sound-based threat notifications.

### Sound Patterns

| Threat Type | Pattern | Frequency | Duration | Description |
|-------------|---------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **DDoS Attack** | Rapid beeps | 1000-1200 Hz | 200-400ms | Urgent high-pitch alarm |
| **Port Scan** | Medium warble | 600-800 Hz | 300ms | Attention-grabbing tone |
| **IP Spoofing** | Alternating tones | 700-900 Hz | 200ms | Warbling alert |
| **User Behavior** | Soft beep | 600 Hz | 400ms | Subtle notification |
| **Emergency** | Siren pattern | 800-1200 Hz | Variable | Multiple threats detected |

### Special Sounds

- **Startup**: Musical chord (A-C#-E) - System online
- **Shutdown**: Descending melody (E-C#-A) - Graceful exit
- **Emergency**: Multi-threat siren (5+ simultaneous alerts)

**Configure audio settings in `config.js` to customize volume, cooldown, and alert preferences.**
