# SnifferX 🔍

A powerful network traffic analyzer combining cybersecurity skills to detect and analyze suspicious network activities.

## 🎯 Project Overview

SnifferX is a network traffic analysis tool designed to capture, analyze, and detect malicious network activities in real-time.

## 🚀 Features (Planned)

- **Packet Capture**: Capture network traffic using Wireshark/pcap integration
- **Traffic Analysis**: Real-time analysis of network packets
- **DDoS Detection**: Identify and alert on DDoS attack patterns
- **IP Spoofing Detection**: Detect spoofed IP addresses
- **Suspicious Activity Monitoring**: Monitor and log unusual network behavior
- **Protocol Analysis**: Deep packet inspection for various protocols
- **Traffic Visualization**: Graphical representation of network traffic
- **Alert System**: Real-time notifications for security threats

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Wireshark/tshark (for packet capture)
- Administrator/Root privileges (for network capture)
