## 📋 What You Need to Prepare

### 1️⃣ **CRITICAL: Install Npcap** ⚠️

**Why?** Npcap is REQUIRED for packet capture on Windows. Without it, we can't capture any network traffic.

**Download:** https://npcap.com/dist/npcap-1.79.exe

**Installation Steps:**
1. Download the installer
2. Run as Administrator
3. ✅ **IMPORTANT:** Check "Install Npcap in WinPcap API-compatible Mode"
4. Complete installation
5. Restart computer (recommended)

**Verification:**
```powershell
# After installation, check if Npcap service is running
Get-Service npcap
```

---

### 2️⃣ **Optional: Install Wireshark**

**Why?** Great for testing, learning, and validating our tool's output.

**Download:** https://www.wireshark.org/download.html

**Note:** Wireshark installer includes Npcap, so you can kill two birds with one stone!

---

### 3️⃣ **System Preparation**

- [ ] Ensure you can run PowerShell/CMD as Administrator
- [ ] Check your network adapter supports promiscuous mode
- [ ] Make sure antivirus won't block packet capture
- [ ] Have a test network environment (your home network is fine)

---

### 4️⃣ **Learning Resources (Optional but Recommended)**

#### **Quick Reads (1-2 hours total):**
- [ ] Wireshark basics tutorial: https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html/
- [ ] TCP/IP basics: https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/tcp-ip/
- [ ] Understanding packets: https://www.practicalnetworking.net/series/packet-traveling/packet-traveling/

#### **Videos (if you prefer):**
- [ ] "Network Basics" - YouTube (30 mins)
- [ ] "Wireshark Tutorial for Beginners" (20 mins)
- [ ] "How TCP/IP Works" (15 mins)

---

### 5️⃣ **Development Environment**

Already set up ✅:
- [x] Node.js v22.19.0
- [x] VS Code
- [x] Git
- [x] npm

To install when we start Phase 2:
- [ ] Additional npm packages (I'll help with this)

## 🚀 When You're Ready

Just say: **"I'm ready to start Phase 2"** and we'll begin with:

1. Installing npm packages
2. Setting up the capture module structure
3. Writing our first packet capture code
4. Testing with real network traffic

---

## ⏱️ Time Investment Estimate

| Activity | Time |
|----------|------|
| Install Npcap | 5-10 minutes |
| Install Wireshark | 10 minutes |
| Learn basics (optional) | 2-5 hours |
| **Total** | **2.5-5.5 hours** |

**Or if you skip learning:** Just 15-20 minutes for installations!

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Install Wireshark** - It includes Npcap and is great for learning
2. **Test Wireshark first** - Capture some traffic to see what we'll be working with
3. **Use your home network** - Safe environment for testing
4. **Take your time** - No rush, understand the concepts
5. **Ask questions** - I'm here to help!

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to be on administrator account all the time?**  
A: Only when running packet capture. Development can be done normally.

**Q: Will this work on WiFi?**  
A: Yes, but wired is easier. WiFi has some limitations.

**Q: Is this legal?**  
A: YES, on YOUR OWN network. Never use on networks you don't own/have permission.

**Q: Can I skip the learning part?**  
A: You can, but you might get confused. I'll explain as we go, but basics help a lot!

**Q: What if I get stuck?**  
A: Ask me! That's what I'm here for. We'll figure it out together.
