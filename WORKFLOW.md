- Write code to initialize network interface
- Capture our FIRST packet (exciting!)
- Print raw packet data to console

**Commands:**
```bash
npm install cap simple-statistics lowdb lodash moment
mkdir src
mkdir src/capture src/detection src/analysis src/storage src/alerts src/models
```

**Deliverable:** Can see raw packet data in terminal

---

### **Session 2: Parse Packets**
**What we'll do:**

- Parse Ethernet frame (source/dest MAC addresses)
- Extract IP header (source/dest IP addresses)
- Identify protocol type (TCP/UDP/ICMP)
- Display in readable format

**Deliverable:** Can see human-readable packet info (Source IP ‚Üí Dest IP, Protocol)

---

### **Session 3: Clean It Up**
**What we'll do:**
- Store packets in memory (array/buffer)

4. Alert when threshold exceeded (> 1000 packets/sec from one IP)
5. Display alert with source IP and packet count

**Algorithm:**
```javascript
// Pseudocode
if (packetsFromIP in last 60sec > threshold) {
    alert("Possible DDoS from " + sourceIP);
}
```

**Deliverable:** DDoS detection working and alerting

---

### **Session 5: Port Scan Detection**
**What we'll do:**

    alert("Port scan detected from " + sourceIP);
}
```

**Deliverable:** Port scan detection working

---

### **Session 6: IP Spoofing Detection**
**What we'll do:**
1. Create `src/detection/ipSpoofingDetector.js`

4. Check for impossible packet combinations
5. Alert on suspicious patterns

**Deliverable:** IP spoofing detection working

---

## **Phase 4: Analysis Engine (Making Sense of Data)**

4. Calculate connection duration
5. Track data transferred per connection

**Deliverable:** Can see active network connections

---

### **Session 9: Protocol Analysis**
**What we'll do:**
1. Create `src/analysis/protocolAnalyzer.js`

### **Session 13: Simple Database**
**What we'll do:**
1. Create `src/storage/databaseManager.js`
2. Set up lowdb (JSON database)
3. Store alerts and incidents
4. Implement query functionality
5. Create statistics history

**Deliverable:** Persistent storage working
